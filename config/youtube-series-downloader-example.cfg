# each of the channels. Defaults to 1 (i.e., no change in speed)
# speed_up_default = 1.5

[vars]
# Use this section to help you specify common paths used in your channel's "dir" variable
# For example, instead of using 'dir = gaming' in almost every channel, you can specify it here
# and use it in your channel as 'dir = ${vars:gaming_dir}'
gaming_dir = gaming

# Put every channel under a different section. The section's name is the directory that the videos
# will be downloaded to for this channel.
# Below you can see an example of how this will look like. Remove this in your own configuration.
[Friendly Channel Name]
# You can get the channel ID by __FIRST__ going to one of their videos, then pressing on their name.
# The channel id is then available in your URL
id = UCcJgOeune0II4a_qi9OMkRA

# (Optional) If you want this series folder to end up in another dir under the specified "series_dir".
# Equals to <<dir>> in <<series_dir>>/<<dir>>/CHANNEL_NAME/Season 01/CHANNEL_NAME - s01eEPISODE_NUMBER - TITLE.mp4
# In this example videos will be under "/mnt/lvm/series/gaming/Friendly Channel Name/Season 01/title - s01e01.mp4
# If you use vars, you can specify this as 'dir = ${vars:gaming_dir}' instead.
dir = gaming

# (Optional) If you want to set another speed than speed_up_default
speed = 2.0

# (Optional) Include patterns in REGEX format. Can be used together with "excludes".
# NOTE! All titles are conventerd into lowercase before matching
# If the include pattern is set, only titles that match any of these patterns will be downloaded
# Example, only download videos that contain the word 'tutorial' or 'highlight'
includes =
    tutorial
    highlight


# (Optional) Exclude patterns in REGEX format. Can be used together with "includes".
# NOTE! All titles are conventerd into lowercase before matching
# If the exclude pattern is set, titles that match any of the exclude patterns won't be downloaded

excludes =
    wordpress
    ^how to
